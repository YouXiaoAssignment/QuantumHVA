# QuantumHVA
Variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) is a applicable way to calculate energy eigenvalues when using a quantum computer with noise. Hence, we use VQE to simulate the quantum properties of quantum spin liquid. We choose the Kitaev model using Hamiltonian variational ansatz (HVA) for simulation.

In this work, we focus on the Kitaev model on two different lattices: honeycomb lattice and square-octagon lattice, using VQE algorithm with HVA to simulate and calculate the ground state energy and mean magnetic moment of the Kitaev model on honeycomb lattice and square-octagon-lattice. We calculated the ground states under dozens of configurations and showed the phase transition with respect to magnetic moment.

**Results are shown in _report.pdf_.  Source codes of the algorithm & curcuit visualization are both committed in this repo.**
